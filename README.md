# AppWrite React Blog App

Following concepts are implemented:


## Cloud Backend

> Implementation of Appwrite that gives BaaS (Backend as a Service) on Cloud (Similar to AWS).


## Vendor Lock-in prevention

> Inorder to separate the dependency of Appwrite which is a Backend as a Service, a separate service has been created. This ensures separating the app if the app needs to be migrated to any other cloud platform.

> Implementation of Clean Code


## Redux Store

> Redux Toolkit is used to track the authentication (login and logout)


## Components Reusablity

> useForwardRef is used to transfer the state from parent to child component


## React Hook Form

> Usage of React hook form for signup and login

> Slug Transformation: used `watch` method of React hook form to watch the activity of the `title` field and transformed slug based on the `title`.


## Mechanism to protect pages and routes

> Protected Container is created to protect pages and routes


## TinyMCE Rich Text Editor
